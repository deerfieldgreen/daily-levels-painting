# daily-levels-panting
Updates daily range levels and save the pine script in daily_range_pine.txt
We need to create a pine script for TradingView to "paint" the levels each day, to automated creating 8 levels by 8 symbols.
In tradingview, you add the script to the Pine Editor, Save and Add to Chart, as an indicator. 

## Flow
1) Receives webhook from QC
2) Processes the data
3) Sends the updated data to txt file stored in this github repo -> daily_range_pine.txt
