# daily-levels-panting

## Description
Updates daily range levels and save the pine script in daily_range_pine.txt



From the Google Spreadsheet that is created here: 



We need to create a pine script for TradingView to "paint" the levels each day, to automated creating 8 levels by 8 symbols. 

In tradingview, you add the script to the Pine Editor, Save and Add to Chart, as an indicator.
